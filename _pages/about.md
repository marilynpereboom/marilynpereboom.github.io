I am currently a predoc in the Applied Economics department at MIT Sloan School of Management working with Professor Catherine Wolfram and Professor Mert Demirer.
 I contribute to research focused on energy markets, trade and climate policy, and empirical industrial organization. I am
especially interested in modeling global energy systems and analyzing policy impacts to support
the global energy transition.
